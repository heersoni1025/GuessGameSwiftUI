## 🙌 Acknowledgments

This app was developed independently for personal learning and exploration of SwiftUI.  
It is **not affiliated with any academic coursework**.

The initial structure and concept were inspired by a Udemy course from **Fullstacktuts LLC**.  
While the project followed video guidance, I wrote the code myself and made several modifications to improve design based on my own ideas.
